## Containers

### Sequence Containers
Data Structures which can be accessed in sequential manner.
- vector
- list (doubly linked list)
- deque
- arrays
- forward_list (singly linked list)

### Container adaptors
Provide different interface for sequential containers.
- queue
- priority_queue
- stack

### Associative containers
Sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(logn) time complexity).
- set 
- multiset
- map
- mutlimap

### Unordered associative containers 
Unordered data structures that can be quickly searched.
- unordered_set
- unordered_multiset
- unordered_map
- unordered_multimap

## Algorithms
- Binary search
- sort
- rotate
- next_permutation
- Lambda functions
- Function pointers
- Swap
- ...
